We are a team of developers who want to have pets, have pets, and love pets. We know how much pet owners value good health care for their pets.

 * FAQ
---------------------
Why have you used MongoDB?
    We have used MongoDB because MongoDB is faster than MySQL due to its ability to handle large amounts of unstructured data when it comes to speed. Furthermore, MongoDB is a full cloud-based application data platform which has flexible document schemas, it even has widely supported and code-native data access and is good to use because of it's change-friendly design. It has a very simple installation and it is good for us because it is cost-effective :)
